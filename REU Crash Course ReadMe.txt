This 2 day course was put together by Erik Huemiller in 2017 for the Physics NSF REU class at 
the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.  

It was designed to take 2 days with 2 hours of instruction each day.

The role of the TA should be one of a hands off mentor who can answer questions if they arise, 
but that does not do much instruction in how to actually use MATLAB.  It was most useful to have 
the TA watch out for and correct syntax errors that came up and answer questions about 
comparisons with other programing languages.
